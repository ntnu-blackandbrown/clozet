# IDATT2105 - Semester Project 2025

**Project Description:**   

A web-based marketplace platform inspired by finn.no, developed as part of the IDATT2105 Full-stack Application Development course in Spring 2025. 
The platform allows users to buy and sell items through a rich user interface, equipped with features like advanced filtering, full-text search, messaging between users. 
The system supports both standard users and administrators, where the former can list and manage items, while the latter have access to category and user management. 
The frontend is built with Vue 3, while the backend is implemented using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3, with MySQL/H2 as the database engine during development,
which is then migrated to PostReg SQL during deployment with Heroku.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, modern security practices, accessibility, and test coverage, and is delivered with CI/CD pipelines and full documentation.

## Introduction
Explain what the project is about and what it aims to solve. Consider including:

- - Background of the project

  The digital marketplace is a well-established concept, yet there is always room for improving user experience, security, and functionality. 
  This project aims to recreate and modernize the core concept of a platform like finn.no – allowing users to list, search for, and buy second-hand or new items – while also emphasizing best practices in full-stack development.

  This project was developed in the context of the IDATT2105 course, where students are tasked with creating a complete full-stack web application using modern technologies. 
  The project is also a voluntary assignment for students seeking to improve their course grade from a C to a B or A, and thus requires high quality in all aspects: code, UI/UX, functionality, security, testing, and documentation.

## Application Structure

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a clean, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
backend/
├── src/main/java/stud/ntnu/no/backend/
│   ├── category/           # Category management
│   ├── user/              # User management
│   ├── item/              # Item listings
│   ├── message/           # Messaging system
│   ├── transaction/       # Transaction handling
│   ├── review/            # Review system
│   ├── favorite/          # Favorites/bookmarks
│   ├── location/          # Location services
│   ├── itemimage/         # Image handling
│   ├── shippingoption/    # Shipping options
│   └── common/            # Shared utilities
```

Each feature package contains:
- `controller/` - REST endpoints and request handling
- `service/` - Business logic implementation
- `repository/` - Data access layer
- `entity/` - Database entities
- `dto/` - Data Transfer Objects
- `exception/` - Custom exceptions
- `mapper/` - MapStruct mappers for entity-DTO conversion

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with Vue 3 and follows a modern component-based architecture:

```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── api/              # API client and endpoints
│   ├── assets/           # Static assets
│   ├── components/       # Reusable Vue components
│   ├── router/           # Vue Router configuration
│   ├── stores/           # Pinia state management
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── views/            # Page components
│   ├── websocket/        # WebSocket integration
│   └── __tests__/        # Test files
```

### Database Entity Relationship Diagram
The following diagram illustrates the database model of the application, showing all entities and their relationships:

![E-commerce Platform Data Model](docs/images/database_diagram.png)

This entity relationship diagram shows the core entities of our application:
- **Users**: Central entity storing user information including authentication details
- **Items**: Products listed for sale with their detailed attributes
- **Categories**: Hierarchical classification system for items
- **Transactions**: Records of sales between users
- **Messages**: Communication between users about specific items
- **Locations**: Geographic data for items and shipping
- **Shipping Options**: Available shipping methods and their details
- **Item Images**: Photos associated with listings
- **Verification/Password Tokens**: Security tokens for account management

The diagram illustrates both the entity attributes and the relationships between them, including foreign key constraints and cardinality.

## API Documentation

Our API documentation is automatically generated using Spring REST Docs, which ensures that the documentation stays in sync with the actual code through test-driven documentation.

### Implementation Overview

1. **Test-Driven Documentation**
   - Documentation is generated through controller tests
   - Each endpoint's documentation is verified during test execution
   - Examples are automatically generated from actual request/response pairs

2. **Documentation Structure**
   ```
   backend/
   ├── src/test/java/
   │   └── .../*ControllerTest.java    # Test files that generate docs
   ├── target/generated-snippets/      # Generated documentation snippets
   └── index.adoc                      # Main documentation file
   |___index.pdf                       # PDF of documentation
  
   ```

3. **Example Documentation Test**
   ```java
   @Test
   void getTopFiveCategories_ShouldReturnListOfCategories() throws Exception {
       mockMvc.perform(get("/api/categories/top-five"))
           .andDo(document("categories-top-five",
               responseFields(
                   fieldWithPath("[].id").description("Category ID"),
                   fieldWithPath("[].name").description("Category name"),
                   // ... other fields
               )
           ));
   }
   ```

### Documentation Generation Process

1. **Test Execution**: Run tests
   ```bash
   # Run from project root
   cd backend
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Snippet Generation**: Tests generate documentation snippets in `target/generated-snippets/`

3. **Index Generation**: Python script combines snippets into final documentation
   ```bash
   # Run from project root
   python docs/API\ Documentation/generate_index.py --snippets-dir backend/target/generated-snippets --output docs/API\ Documentation/index.adoc
   ```
### Documentation Content
- Request/response formats with examples
- Detailed field descriptions and types
- Sample request/response payloads
- HTTP status codes and their meanings
- Authentication requirements per endpoint

### Accessing Documentation

The documentation can be accessed through the index.pdf file within the docs folder

# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=UserServiceTest

# Package with tests
mvn package
```

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run from project root
cd frontend

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests in development mode

```

#### WebSocket Testing
```bash
# Run from project root
cd backend
# Run WebSocket integration tests
mvn test -Dtest=WebSocketIntegrationTest

# Run from project root
cd frontend
# Run WebSocket client tests
npm run test:websocket
```

#### Manual WebSocket Testing
To test WebSocket functionality using the HTML test client:

1. First, start the backend server in production mode:
   ```bash
   # Run from project root
   cd backend
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod
   ```

2. Once the backend server is running, open the WebSocket test HTML file in your browser:
   ```bash
   # Run in a new terminal window while the backend is running
   # Open the file in your default browser
   # Windows
   start backend/src/test/java/stud/ntnu/no/backend/message/websocket/websocket-test.html
   
   # macOS
   open backend/src/test/java/stud/ntnu/no/backend/message/websocket/websocket-test.html
   
   # Linux
   xdg-open backend/src/test/java/stud/ntnu/no/backend/message/websocket/websocket-test.html
   ```

3. In the WebSocket test client:
   - Verify the server URL is set to `http://localhost:8080/ws`
   - Click "Connect" to establish a WebSocket connection
   - Send test messages between users
   - Monitor real-time WebSocket communication

For detailed information on WebSocket testing, refer to the [WebSocket Testing Guide](websocket%20testing.pdf) in the project root.

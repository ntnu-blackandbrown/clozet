# IDATT2105 - Semester Project 2025

**Project Description:**   

A web-based marketplace platform inspired by finn.no, developed as part of the IDATT2105 Full-stack Application Development course in Spring 2025. 
The platform allows users to buy and sell items through a rich user interface, equipped with features like advanced filtering, full-text search, messaging between users. 
The system supports both standard users and administrators, where the former can list and manage items, while the latter have access to category and user management. 
The frontend is built with Vue 3, while the backend is implemented using Java 21 and Spring Boot 3, with MySQL/H2 as the database engine during development,
which is then migrated to PostReg SQL during deployment with Heroku.

The project emphasizes clean architecture, modern security practices, accessibility, and test coverage, and is delivered with CI/CD pipelines and full documentation.

## Introduction
Explain what the project is about and what it aims to solve. Consider including:

- - Background of the project

  The digital marketplace is a well-established concept, yet there is always room for improving user experience, security, and functionality. 
  This project aims to recreate and modernize the core concept of a platform like finn.no ‚Äì allowing users to list, search for, and buy second-hand or new items ‚Äì while also emphasizing best practices in full-stack development.

  This project was developed in the context of the IDATT2105 course, where students are tasked with creating a complete full-stack web application using modern technologies. 
  The project is also a voluntary assignment for students seeking to improve their course grade from a C to a B or A, and thus requires high quality in all aspects: code, UI/UX, functionality, security, testing, and documentation.
